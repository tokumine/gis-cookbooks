# Backup Configuration File
# 
# Use the "backup" block to add backup settings to the configuration file.
# The argument before the "do" in (backup "argument" do) is called a "trigger".
# This acts as the identifier for the configuration.
#
# In the example below we have a "mysql-backup-s3" trigger for the backup setting.
# All the configuration is done inside this block. To initialize the backup process for this block,
# you invoke it using the following command:
#
#   backup --run mysql-backup-s3
# 
# You can add as many backup block settings as you want, just be sure every trigger is unique and you can run
# each of them separately.
# 
# ADAPTERS
#  - MySQL
#  - PostgreSQL
#  - Archive
#  - Custom
#
# STORAGE METHODS
#  - S3 (Amazon)
#  - SCP (Remote Server)
#  - FTP (Remote Server)
#  - SFTP (Remote Server)
#
# GLOBAL OPTIONS
#  - Keep Backups (keep_backups)
#  - Encrypt With Pasword (encrypt_with_password)
#
#  This is the "decrypt" command for all encrypted backups:
#    sudo backup --decrypt /path/to/encrypted/file
#
# Each Backup Setting can contain:
# - 1 Adapter
# - 1 Storage Method
# - Multiple Global Options
#
# The combination of these, however, do not matter! So experiment with it.
# 
# You can also let Backup notify you by email on successfully created backups.
# - Just uncomment the block of code below (notifier_settings) and fill in your credentials.
# - Then for set "notify" to "true" in each (backup) block you wish to be notified of.
#
# For more information on "Backup", please refer to the wiki on github
#   http://wiki.github.com/meskyanichi/backup/configuration-file


# Notifier
#   Uncomment this if you want to enable notification by email on successful backup runs
#   You will also have to set "notify true" inside each backup block below to enable it for that particular backup
